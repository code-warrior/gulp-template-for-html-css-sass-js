 * rendering feedback on the answer the user submits.
 *
 * The switch statement is checking the value submitted by the <option> element of
 * the form bound to the question “Where Was Lincoln Born?” In each of the three
 * cases, “lansing,” “hodgenville,” and “washington,” the transition class is removed
 * from the <section> element (line 27 in the HTML file) so that a new transition can
 * be included later in each of the three cases.
 *
 * Also, in each of the three cases, following the removal of the class “transition,”
 * a timer is set to run after 250 milliseconds that fills the paragraph child of the
 * section element. The lines containing p.innerHTML are self-explanatory.
 *
 * Within the same timer, the transition class is added anew.
 *
 * In the “hodgenville” case, which is the correct answer to the question regarding
 * the location of Lincoln’s birth place, a button with the text “Next Question” is
 * set to display, and a second timer is added for the transition of that button.
